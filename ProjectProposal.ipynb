    "Our team loves video games, which is becoming an increasingly popular and powerful industry despite being fairly new. For example, Pong, one of the first video games to exist, came out in 1972. Less than 50 years later, the industry has exploded and become culturally relevant and financially lucrative (both understatements). From a fan point of view, we've all heard discussions about buying the latest console or the next popular game, which often leads to comparisons. What console should you buy when two of your favorite games might be limited to separate consoles? Do parents understand the increasing cultural relevance of video games, and what games would they let their children play? In addition to these questions, a business point of view may want to see how these factors affect the bottom line, which will in turn change their business tactics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The console question in particular stems from a cultural phenomenon often referred to as the \"console wars.\" Although it has many definitions, to us this is a polarizing discussion that encourages consumers to establish their identity by buying a certain console. For example, in the Nielsen study, many consumers remain loyal to a certain console brand, continuing to buy generation iterations because they identify with the “Fun-Factor” or “Better for Kids” values of a Nintendo system. Our hypothesis comes from this idea, which is that sales are greatly affected by these console-identity purchases. Although we are limited because such data does not exist, we would like to draw (limited) conclusions based on the (purely correlated) findings of this research question. On the other hand, the industry has grown tremendously throughout the years but sales are affected by specific factors, such as lack of interest or the start of a popular franchise. There are growth periods in any business, such as the commonly referred to “decade of marked innovation in video games” in the 90s (see Wiki reference). Therefore, industry / sales growth is non-linear over the years and would be least likely to impact video game sales. It would be better to identify what factors specifically affected sales during certain periods to understand why sales had changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we're pursuing this research question to find trends and therefore possibly predict where the industry might be heading. Apart from appeasing our fan curiosity, this could be helpful data to aforementioned businesses to optimize their tactics. Although this data would be more useful for businesses, the common consumer will have access to this data as well and can react accordingly with their dollar. For example, if we discover that the game title itself most affects sales and not the consoles, a consumer could choose to share a console with friends to eliminate the cost of multiple consoles but still enjoy the game. Or perhaps a solo video game developer can see what genres affects sales the most - then he can pursue his dream to develop games but still make a living by selling a game in a popular genre.\n",

    "There are several missing values throughout the data set, so we would have to decide on how to approach this. Given that these missing values comprise less than 1% of the entire data set, we have decided that it would be best to delete the rows that contain these missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may also be some skewedness when analyzing the different video game sales throughout the different regions, as it seems that there are more sales in the US than in any other region upon first glance. \n",
    "Also, the sales are the cumulative sales over the 1983-2017 period. Creating separate columns that look at the yearly sales of each game throughout this period can be helpful to us in answering our questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "\n",
    "To pre-process the data, we will check our data distributions to see if they are skewed, in which case we’ll need to create lognormal distributions by multiplying the data by log. That way, our distributions are more readable. Most of our analysis will be seeing which factors are the most correlated by comparing r-values between sales and a variable factor. An example would be running a Pearson correlation between genre and sales, where we total all sales for a particular genre and compare it to the number of games in that genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "We may also use regression methods in order to predict what type of combination of factors will generate the most sales by region. For example, we can use the simple regression method for genre and sales to predict which genre will generate more sales in the future. When we want to compare more than one independent variable (e.g. genre AND console vs. sales), we will use the multiple regression method. However, it’s important not to mistake a combination of the highest performing factors as the winning sales formula - some things may not be compatible, such as a Mario game on a Xbox console (strongly protected intellectual property from different companies). Therefore, we must sift through the data to exclude (presumably) impossible combinations, though that may be a fun but impractical practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we will report the p-values of each factor on the game sales after using linear regression. \n",
    "Since some of the factors are categorical and the dependent variable is continuous, reporting the results of an ANOVA test may be heplful as well. Creating different graphs for the different levels of each of the categorical variables on the sales will also be helpful to visualize what impacts video game sales.  \n",

Additionally, since it was generated from web scraping www.vgchartz.com, which is publicly available information, there are no privacy concerns, nor is there any personal identifiable information available. This site estimates sales through a variety of methods, including polling users on games purchased, polling retailers on sales numbers, and asking manufacturers for production estimates. This method of data collection introduces potential biases from the polling processes, which may also reflect why the dataset only includes the regions NA, EU, JP, and other. While these are common region groupings in video games, it does not provide information about trends within each region. This may be significant, especially in the EU group, due to how many countries are encompassed, and how political and economic climates in a given region may affect sales in that time frame. These issues with how the data was collected will likely appear in any publically available dataset, and short of collecting our own data from retailers and manufacturers, it just will have to be something we take into consideration when interpreting the results."

Though on the surface it seems like we are doing an analysis of sales, we believe, however, that this provides greater insight into not only the video game industry, but people's tastes and preferences when it comes to electronic entertainment. \n",
    "Through doing our project on video game sales, we are analyzing regional preferences, which is an interesting field to explore. We can see how these different tastes vary not only through space (ie. region by region), but through time as well. Examining these patterns can provide more insight into the what consumers want, and through this information, companies can create better products that not only capture the most popular video game trends at the moment, but revolutionize electronic entertainment as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our analyses hypotheses on which factors most strongly influence video game sales are correct, then we believe this will show that companies should focus more on developing certain genres on certain consoles. This has the potential to cause a shift in what is being developed where, leading to whole new gaming trends. \n",
    "If they are wrong, or our proposed methods are unable to arrive at valid conclusions, then we will change our current methods, as well as the questions that we are asking. For instance, our questions may be too broad, thus making analysis difficult. To counter this, we will need to be more detailed with our questions. If our methods fail, then this calls for visiting more sources and researching other methods that we can use.\n",

Of course, we will learn plenty throughout this course, but there may be other, more advanced methods that we can potentially utilize for our project, but will not be taught in the course.\n",
    "Other pitfalls include how this dataset was scraped from only one website. Records of video game sales can vary from site to site, especially when recording the sales of lesser-known video games. This can lead us to believing that certain games are less popular than others, when in fact they are just incorrectly documented. \n"
