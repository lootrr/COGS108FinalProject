    "The topic domain of our project concerns the sales of video games over a period of time. Though on the surface it seems like we are doing an analysis of sales, we believe, however, that this provides greater insight into not only the video game industry, but people's tastes and preferences when it comes to electronic entertainment. \n",
    "Through doing our project on video game sales, we are analyzing regional preferences, which is an interesting field to explore. We can see how these different tastes vary not only through space (ie. region by region), but through time as well. Examining these patterns can provide more insight into the what consumers want, and through this information, companies can create better products that not only capture the most popular video game trends at the moment, but revolutionize electronic entertainment as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "If our analyses hypotheses on which factors most strongly influence video game sales are correct, then we believe this will show that companies should focus more on developing certain genres on certain consoles. This has the potential to cause a shift in what is being developed where, leading to whole new gaming trends. \n",
    "If they are wrong, or our proposed methods are unable to arrive at valid conclusions, then we will change our current methods, as well as the questions that we are asking. For instance, our questions may be too broad, thus making analysis difficult. To counter this, we will need to be more detailed with our questions. If our methods fail, then this calls for visiting more sources and researching other methods that we can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential pitfalls and confounds of our data and methods that can cause problems includes how limited we are in terms of the types of statistical tools we can use to analyze our data. Of course, we will learn plenty throughout this course, but there may be other, more advanced methods that we can potentially utilize for our project, but will not be taught in the course.\n",
    "Other pitfalls include how this dataset was scraped from only one website. Records of video game sales can vary from site to site, especially when recording the sales of lesser-known video games. This can lead us to believing that certain games are less popular than others, when in fact they are just incorrectly documented. \n"
